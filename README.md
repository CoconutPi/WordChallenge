## Acknowledgement

* Thank you [NASPA Zyzzyva](https://github.com/boshvark/zyzzyva-pc) for providing dictionaries of valid words to Scrabble lovers all around the world. Zyzzyva was used at every Scrabble tournament I have gone to. I am excited to be able to use part of Zyzzyva open source for my personal Scrabble-like game project.
* Thank you [Duong Vu](https://github.com/duongvu96) and [Jason Wangsadinata](https://github.com/jwangsadinata) for leading [amazing web development forum](https://github.com/Comp420). Without the knowledge, I wouldn't be able to finish the whole game in less than 24 hours on my own.
