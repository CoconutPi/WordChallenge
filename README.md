Thank you [NASPA Zyzzyva](https://github.com/boshvark/zyzzyva-pc) for providing dictionaries of valid words to Scrabble lovers all around the world. Zyzzyva was used at every Scrabble tournament I have gone to. I am excited to be able to use part of Zyzzyva open source for my Scrabble-like game project.
